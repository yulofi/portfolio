        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi there! My name is <b>Uzziel Allan Carolino</b>, and I'm an 18-year-old senior high school graduate from the Philippines with a wide range of interests and skills. I'm a highly motivated and passionate individual, always eager to learn and explore new opportunities.</p>

            <p>Programming became one of my hobbies and passions.  I may have limited knowledge and skills, but I am very determined to expand my expertise in this field. Okay, you might be wondering why I'm here. How did I become passionate about programming? Here's my short story. I love playing video games. Some of my favorites are Minecraft, Call of Duty, and other FPS games. Way back in 2017, when I was 12 years old, I wondered, "How are video games made?" Using my phone, I quickly searched how video games are made, and that's where I discovered the word "programming" or "coding." Then I searched more about it, and that's where I also discovered "C++." I wondered what C++ was, and I kept seeing it everywhere. I found out that I needed to learn it in order to create a video game. Yes, C++ was the first programming language I learned. I searched for videos and applications that could help me learn it, and that's where I discovered the <a href="https://www.sololearn.com" target="blank_" style="text-decoration:none;">SoloLearn</a> app. SoloLearn is a mobile learning platform that offers interactive courses and challenges to help users learn to code.  Throughout the lessons I completed, I learned a lot and really enjoyed studying.</p>
            <p>Several days passed, and the lessons became increasingly difficult to the point that I could no longer understand them, so I stopped.  The only thing I learned were the basic concepts of programming.</p>
            <p>The year 2020 marked my return to studying programming. However, I didn't continue with C++ because I realized that app or game development wasn't as easy as I thought. That's when I decided to learn other languages.  On the Sololearn app, I noticed that many users were working primarily with HTML, so I decided to learn it too. Since then, I've focused on web development. I've finished learning HTML, am still improving my CSS skills, and am learning more about JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I worked on many projects to improve my skills. I created a professional-looking website, iterating on my portfolio several times. I also developed simple JavaScript games, among other things.</p>
            <p>These projects represent just a sample of my work and dedication to continuous improvement. I'm excited to see what I can accomplish next.</p>
